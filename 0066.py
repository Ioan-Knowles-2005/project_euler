# Diophantine Equation
# Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form: x^2 - D*y^2 = 1
# For example when D = 13 the minimal solution in x is 649^2 - 13 * 180^2 = 1
# It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is square.
# By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7} we obtain the following:
# 3^2 - 2 * 2^2 = 1
# 2^2 - 3 * 1^2 = 1
# 9^2 - 5 * 4^2 = 1
# 5^2 - 6 * 2^2 = 1
# 8^2 - 7 * 3^2 = 1
# Hence by considering the minimal solutions in x for D <= 7, the largest x is obtained when D=5
# Find the value of D <= 1000 in minimal solutions in x for which the largest value of x is obtained
