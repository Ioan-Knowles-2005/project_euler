Project Euler is a website with several maths problems which usually require some mathematical intuition along with coding.

This is my code for solving the first 100 project euler problems. I am unable to post anymore due to project euler having explicit rules
on publishing answers, however if you would like any insight into my other answers, feel free to message me and I will share my thoughts into 
the question and my code to solve it.
This code can likely be optimised in various ways as a couple early answers are simply brute force as the numbers are smaller enough to result in 
a decent runtime.
